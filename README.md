# JavaLogger
Data logger under Java for capturing packets and creating columns of time response data

The goals of this project are to support Team 293 SPIKE datalogging during design/development/build.
We will capture data from a packet and write a text file with columns of numbers, the first column containing a time hack.
Hopefully we can transmit a packet of information as part of the "standard" 20ms time loop associated with robot control, dictated by the servo PWM rep rate.
